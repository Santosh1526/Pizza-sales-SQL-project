## Pizza Sales Store Analysis (SQL Project)🧑🏻‍💻🍕

I worked on a comprehensive SQL project using MySQL to analyze pizza sales data. In this project, I created and connected four key tables—orders, order_details, and pizzas—to perform in-depth data analysis. The project involved writing optimized SQL queries to uncover insights such as total sales, popular pizza types, cumulative revenue and sales trends over time.

## ✅ Key Objectives and Queries Covered:
🔺 Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
🔺Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
🔺 Identify the highest-priced pizza.
🔺Find the most commonly ordered pizza size.

## 💡 Intermediate & Advanced Insights:
🔺Join tables to Analyse pizza category-wise sales.
🔺 Analyse order distribution by hour of the day.
🔺 Calculate average pizzas ordered per day.
🔺 Determine top 3 pizzas by revenue (overall & per category).
🔺Track cumulative revenue over time.

🔗 Tools Used: MySQL Workbench
📊 Skills: SQL Joins, Aggregation, Grouping, Ranking, Mac Functions, Time-based analysis and Utilising SQL queries.
